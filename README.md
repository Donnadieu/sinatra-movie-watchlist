# Welcome to A-List!

A-List is a Sinatra app that can help you keep track of movies you have seen or want to see. Create an account to be able to add movies to your list, including optional notes, genre, and whether or not you've seen the movie. Once you have started adding movies, you can filter your movies by genre and status. You can edit or delete any movie at any time. Happy watching!
